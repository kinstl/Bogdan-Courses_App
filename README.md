# Bogdan-Courses_App

## Overview

This React application serves as an interactive course catalog. Using React Router, it enables navigation between different pages, simulating a multi-page website experience within a single-page application. Users can browse through a list of programming courses and use query parameters to sort and filter results.

## Features

- **Navigation Menu**: A top navigation menu that includes links to the Home, Courses, About, and Contacts pages.
- **Dynamic Course Listing**: The Courses page dynamically lists various programming courses.
- **Sorting Functionality**: Courses can be sorted through query parameters (e.g., `/courses?sort=title`) to organize the course list based on the selected criteria.
- **React Router Implementation**: Demonstrates the use of React Router for navigating between pages without full page reloads.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
